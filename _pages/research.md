In my PhD, I am applying concepts from **spatial ecology** and **population genetics** to test the hypothesis that the spatial configuration and environmental conditions of urban areas influence adaptive and non-adaptive evolutionary processes in a native plant species of high conservation value, *Asclepias syriaca* (common milkweed).

I'm currently researching
  1. How urbanization affects the evolutionary ecology of an animal-pollinated plant and its pollinators,
  2. The extent of genetic divergence among A. syriaca subpopulations in response to urbanization and urban green corridors, and
  3. The consistency with which non-adaptive evolutionary processes shape the genomic structure of multiple urban metapopulations.
