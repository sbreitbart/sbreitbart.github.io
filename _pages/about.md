Hi there! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the [University of Toronto](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/). My advisors are Drs. [Marc Johnson](https://evoecolab.wordpress.com/) and [Helene Wagner](http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/wagnerlab).  

**My research focuses on how urbanization, or the development of cities, influences the ecology and evolution of common milkweed** (a favorite of Monarch butterflies). More and more people are moving to cities- currently half the human population lives in urban areas- and by understanding how these unique environments affect wildlife on the long term, we can design resilient cities that act as healthy ecosystems for wildlife as well as people.

I'm also developing a keen interest in coding well and teaching how to do so. I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

Before graduate school, I earned my B.A. in Biology with a Certificate in Integrative Genomics Sciences from [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/). After completing my B.A., I spent two years working at an [ecological restoration firm](https://princetonhydro.com/).  

In my free time I like to go to concerts, explore Toronto's fascinating neighborhoods (there are >150!), dream about owing a dog one day, and contemplate the wonders of evolutionary resilience.
