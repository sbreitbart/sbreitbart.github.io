<span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: lightblue;">After I graduate in April 2024, I will be looking for a position as an environmental/ecological data analyst/scientist.</span>

*I have 6 years of experience working in R and 9 years working with data. I have a B.A. in Biology with a certificate in Integrative Genomics Sciences, and by 2024 I will (likely!) have a PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. [Here is a link to my resume and CV.](/cv.md)*

*I will be located in Rhode Island and am enthusiastic about remote positions.*

*In this next chapter, I'm looking forward to continuing to use computational tools to make meaning out of ecological data for diverse audiences.*

*Thanks so much. **Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect**- I love getting to know new people!*

Hi there! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the [University of Toronto](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/). My advisors are Drs. [Marc Johnson](https://evoecolab.wordpress.com/) and [Helene Wagner](http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/wagnerlab).

**My research focuses on how urbanization influences the ecology and evolution of common milkweed** (a favorite of Monarch butterflies). More and more people are moving to cities--- did you know that over half the human population lives in urban areas?!--- and by understanding how these unique environments affect wildlife on the long term, we can design resilient cities that act as healthy ecosystems for wildlife as well as people.

I'm also developing a keen interest in coding well and teaching how to do so. I have co-instructed multiple R coding workshops at conferences (e.g. [ESA](https://sbreitbart.github.io/DataSci_for_Ecologists/), [CSEE, SORTEE](https://afilazzola.github.io/FastR/)) and [locally through UofT](https://sbreitbart.github.io/BGSS_Retreat_2021_Workshop/). I'm a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and am an executive member of [UofT Coders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/).

Before graduate school, I earned my B.A. in Biology with a Certificate in Integrative Genomics Sciences from [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/). Next, I was lucky enough to spend two years as a staff scientist at an [ecological restoration firm](https://princetonhydro.com/) and learn about all sorts of things--- especially field work, multi-year project management, and the value of incredible coworkers.

In my free time I like to go to concerts, explore Toronto's fascinating neighborhoods (there are >150!), tinker and learn new skills with [weekend coding projects](/portfolio.md), and contemplate the wonders of evolutionary resilience.
