Some of my favorite ways to participate in community engagement are through mentoring younger scientists, practicing science communication (both verbally and through writing), and getting outside. Nonetheless, I also enjoy learning other ways to promote science education, underrepresented groups in STEM, and conservation. Here are some recent activities:

I am a coordinator for the Toronto chapter of [CAGIS](https://girlsinscience.ca/what-is-cagis/), a club whose **mission is to encourage young girls and gender non-conforming youth (age 7-16) to explore the STEM fields with hands-on activities**. Since I began volunteering with CAGIS in 2019, I've assisted these budding scientists as **they've built solar-powered cars, searched for fungi in High Park, pondered the logistics of space travel, and constructed mini greenhouses** for germinating household seeds and beans. As a coordinator since 2020, my role has expanded to include organizing virtual events with community partners in academia, industry, and government.

# Contributing Writer, "Life in the City"
### *A blog about urban evolution*

**In an effort to hone my written science communication skills**, I regularly contribute articles to [Life in the City](https://urbanevolution-litc.com/author/sophie-breitbart/), a blog about urban evolution. I've searched for the boundary between urban/nonurban (hint: [let me know if you find it](https://urbanevolution-litc.com/2019/07/30/urbanization-beyond-where-the-sidewalk-ends/)), explored a relatively uncharted biome associated with urbanization ([the "indoor biome"](https://urbanevolution-litc.com/2019/09/03/what-is-the-indoor-biome/)), [compiled auditory learning resources on urban evolution](https://urbanevolution-litc.com/2018/12/14/audible-resources-for-urban-evolution/), and more. I enjoy blogging as **a way to challenge myself by breaking down a complex idea into fundamental parts.** I also see it as **an opportunity to inspire the public by using accessible language** so that they, too, can appreciate the amazing world of urban evolution.

[The High Park Nature Stewards](http://www.highparknature.org/wiki/wiki.php?n=VolunteerOpportunities.AboutTheVSP) are a tireless group of volunteers committed to **restoring the park's majestic Black Oak savannah and adjacent natural areas.** Since joining in 2018, **I've spent many a Saturday uprooting invasive weeds, collecting seeds from native plants**, and helping out at the fall Native Plant Sale. I look forward to when our gatherings recommence post-pandemic!

*Come for the field work, stay for the cicadas!*

# Steering Committee Member, WesWIS
### *Wesleyan Women in Science*

[WesWIS](https://www.wesleyan.edu/wis/index.html) is a student group devoted to **building a supportive community among women in STEM**. In my three years as a steering committee member, I helped organized many events including **lab tours, student-faculty lunches, and informational panels** about topics ranging from summer research opportunities to post-college careers. I was eager to become a leader of this club because its positive influence is immeasurable. WesWIS is where many students (including myself) learn about the existence of imposter syndrome and realize they aren't struggling alone. The club also provides participants with opportunities to get to know their professors, which oftentimes leads to organic conversations about getting involved in research. WesWIS also offers students a place to find supportive classmates who can encourage each other to persevere through the oftentimes inspiring, sometimes grueling, but always challenging Wesleyan science courses.
